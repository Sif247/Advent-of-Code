# Advent-of-Code

Advent of Code (AOC) is an annual event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to December 25th. Each puzzle challenges your problem-solving skills and offers an opportunity to practice algorithms, data structures, and coding techniques. This repository contains my solutions for the 2024 edition of the event.
